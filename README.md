# About ReactJS

React isa declarative JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

## React Poster Project

React Poster is a gateway to learning ReactJS
It is focused on the fundamentals of ReactJS and how to use it to build a simple web application.

Essentials learnt include working with props, components, state, and useEffect. And how to add routing to support multi-page experiences while still being in a single page application.

I also learned how React Router can help with data loading and data submission.
